					<p>CCAV is a clan originated from Starcraft 2 <acronym title="North America">NA</acronym> server. But it thrives in the game World of Tanks. Now we also play other popular games like Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, or other popular games on Steam.</p>
					<p>We have a lot of talented players with average WN8 2500+ in World of Tanks in our clan. We also have starcraft players in master league or top 500 in Overwatch. For World of Tanks, most players from our clan are now in <dfn title="players above 99.99%">super-unicum</dfn> clans like Bulba, Mahou, etc.</p>

					<p>Our primary language is Chinese but English is viable. We use both Teamspeak3 and Discord as voice channel for different purposes.</p>
					<p>At this moment, CCAV is not recruiting new members because we are a DEAD clan due to lack of active players. Joining us would not bring a lot experience or benenfits in the games but you are always welcome to become a friend of us by <a href="join_us.html">applying</a>.</p>
